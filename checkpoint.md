# Literature Review Checkpoint

Last Updated: 2025-12-28T23:55:00

## THESIS INTENTION (North Star)

**Title:** "Worlds Within Reach: AI-Assisted Worldbuilding for Independent Development"

**The Dream:** Create **Relics** - a Skyrim-scale open-world dark fantasy action RPG set in the Shadow Realm - as a solo developer using AI and procedural tools.

**Central Question:** Can AI and procedural tools restore the creator-to-creation ratio that existed before games went 3D, enabling small teams to create open-world RPG experiences?

**Key Focus:**
- Worldbuilding for **games** (not literature), specifically **RPGs**
- **Medieval fantasy** settings (Shadow Realm, vampires, werewolves, Schattenfieber)
- **Unreal Engine 5.6+** pipeline (Nanite, Lumen, PCG framework)
- **Houdini** and procedural terrain/environment generation
- **Procedural animation** (motion matching, learned locomotion)
- **3D asset generation** and **texture generation**
- Tools that exist TODAY or are emerging - practical focus
