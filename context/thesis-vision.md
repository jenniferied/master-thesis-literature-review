# Thesis Vision & Context

## Project: Relics

A dark medieval fantasy open-world action RPG set in the **Shadow Realm** - a world scarred by ancient conflicts, inhabited by supernatural creatures (vampires, werewolves, otherworldly entities), and threatened by a disease called Schattenfieber (Shadow Fever).

**Game Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.6+
**Inspiration:** The Elder Scrolls (Skyrim), Vampire: The Masquerade, The Witcher 3, Gothic

## Thesis Title

**"Worlds Within Reach: AI-Assisted Worldbuilding for Independent Development"**

## Central Research Question

Can AI and procedural tools restore the creator-to-creation ratio that existed before games went 3D, enabling small teams to create open-world RPG experiences?

## Abstract

We are living through a technological revolution in media production. Artificial intelligence is reshaping how we create films, games, virtual environments, and interactive experiences at a pace that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.

This thesis focuses on fun and creation - the joy of playing, and increasingly, the joy of being a creator. In the early decades of video games, small teams or solo developers could create titles that captivated millions. But the moment a game aspires to vast, detailed 3D worlds, team size explodes. Games like *The Elder Scrolls* require hundreds of people and budgets exceeding $100M.

The emergence of AI-assisted creation tools raises a tantalizing question: Can these technologies restore something of the creator-to-creation ratio that existed before games went three-dimensional?

This thesis explores that possibility using the open-world RPG as its lens—because RPGs demand the full stack of worldbuilding: setting, characters, systems, narrative, and interactivity. It surveys AI-assisted creation tools and documents a practical attempt to build a prototype world.

**Scope:** Building a single biome proof of concept, documenting what works, what fails, and what remains beyond current tools.

## The Tension

AI can be a tool for exploitation or empowerment:
- Large corporations use it to replace artists and generate forgettable content
- Small teams might use it to realize visions that would otherwise be impossible

This thesis explores the second possibility.

## Current Gaps Identified

The following areas need additional research coverage:

### Procedural Animation
- Motion matching
- Learned locomotion
- NVIDIA animation tech (Audio2Face, motion synthesis)
- ML muscle deformation
- Physics-based character tech

### Houdini & Procedural Environments
- Houdini ML/AI integration
- Professional terrain generation workflows
- Procedural environment automation

### Texture & Material Generation
- Tileable texture generation
- AI-assisted material pipelines
- Style transfer for game assets

### UE5 Integration
- PCG framework research
- Nanite/Lumen optimization
- World Partition for open worlds

## Thesis Structure

1. **Introduction** - The Skyrim Problem, AI opportunity
2. **Background** - Evolution from tabletop RPGs to 3D games
3. **The AI-Assisted Creation Pipeline** - Tool survey
4. **From Document to World** - GDD, Worldbuilding Bible, practical project
5. **Reflection & Implications** - Honest assessment of feasibility
6. **Conclusion** - Findings and future directions

## North Star

Create a Skyrim-scale open-world dark fantasy RPG as a solo/small team using AI and procedural tools that exist or are emerging.
