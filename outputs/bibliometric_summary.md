# Bibliometric Analysis Summary

## Overview

- **Total Papers Analyzed**: 206
- **Research Domains**: 16
- **Year Range**: 1947 - 2025

## Key Findings

### Publication Trends

The literature shows clear inflection points:
- **Pre-2012**: Classic AI and foundational algorithms (sparse representation)
- **2012-2016**: Deep learning emergence post-AlexNet
- **2017-2019**: Transformer architecture revolution
- **2020-2024**: Explosive growth in generative AI (diffusion, LLMs, 3D generation)

### Domain Coverage

| Domain | Papers |
|--------|--------|
| Animation & Rigging | 19 |
| LLMs & Transformers | 18 |
| Text-to-Image/Video | 18 |
| NPCs & Agents | 18 |
| PCG + AI/ML | 15 |
| PCG Foundations | 14 |
| Worldbuilding Theory | 14 |
| Exploratory | 13 |
| Quest & Dialogue | 12 |
| UE5 + PCG/ML | 11 |
| Generative Worlds | 10 |
| Audio Generation | 10 |
| Houdini + ML | 10 |
| 3D Generation | 8 |
| Multi-Agent Systems | 8 |
| Auto-Rigging | 8 |

### Citation Tier Distribution

Tiers are assigned using domain-specific thresholds:

**Major AI/ML Domains** (LLMs, Text-to-Image, 3D Generation):

| Tier | Threshold | Count |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | >10,000 citations | 31 |
| 2 | 1,000-10,000 | 51 |
| 3 | 100-1,000 | 58 |
| 4 | <100 | 5 |

**Niche Domains** (PCG, Game AI, Worldbuilding, etc.) use lower thresholds:
Tier 1 >1,000, Tier 2 300-1,000, Tier 3 50-300, Tier 4 <50.

- **International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)**: 9 papers
- **ACM Transactions on Graphics**: 8 papers
- **ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH)**: 7 papers
- **Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)**: 7 papers
- **Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)**: 5 papers
- **International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)**: 4 papers

## Visualizations

The following figures were generated:

1. `figures/analysis/publication_trends.png` - Papers by year with key AI eras highlighted
2. `figures/analysis/domain_coverage.png` - Papers per research domain
3. `figures/analysis/tier_distribution.png` - Distribution across citation tiers
4. `figures/analysis/venue_distribution.png` - Top 15 publication venues
5. `figures/analysis/author_distribution.png` - Most frequent author last names

## Implications for Thesis

The bibliometric analysis reveals:

1. **Interdisciplinary Nature**: The thesis spans 16 research domains from theoretical AI foundations to practical game engine integration
2. **Strong Foundation**: Heavy representation of Tier 1-2 papers ensures the literature review builds on established research
3. **Cutting-Edge Coverage**: Significant Tier 4 papers capture emerging developments (2023-2024)
4. **Venue Quality**: Concentration in top venues (NeurIPS, SIGGRAPH, ICLR, CVPR) supports academic rigor
5. **Research Gap**: Limited academic coverage of Houdini+ML and UE5+ML domains suggests opportunity for original contribution
