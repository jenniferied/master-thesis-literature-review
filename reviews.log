### Key Issues
1. **Missing papers:** Hendrikx et al. (2013) survey, Smith & Whitehead (2010) expressive range, mixed-initiative papers (Sentient Sketchbook)
2. **Missing techniques:** BSP, Voronoi, Diamond-Square algorithm
3. **Weak thesis connection:** Insufficient link to "enabling small teams" for open-world RPGs
4. **Poor narrative:** Placeholder synthesis, no chronological progression
